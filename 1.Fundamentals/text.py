# Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:
word = "Python"
print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[2])
print(word[3])
print(word[4])
print(word[5])

print("-------")

# Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:
print(word[-1])
print(word[-2])
print(word[-3])
print(word[-4])
print(word[-5])
print(word[-6])

print("-------")

# In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substring:
print(word[0:2])
print(word[0:4])
print(word[2:5])

print("-------")

# Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
print(word[:2])
print(word[:5])
print(word[2:])
print(word[4:])
print(word[-2:])
print(word[:-2])

print("-------")

# Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
print(word[:2] + word[2:])
print(word[:4] + word[4:])

print("-------")

# Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:
# print(word[7])

# print("-------")

# However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:
print(word[4:42])
print(word[42:])

print("-------")

# Python strings cannot be changed â€” they are immutable. Therefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:
# print(word[0] = "J")
print(word[0] == "J")
# print(word[2:] = "Jy")
print(word[2:] == "Jy")
print(word[2:] == "py")
print(word[2:] == "Py")
print(word[2:] == "thon")

print("-------")

# If you need a different string, you should create a new one:
print("J" + word[1:])
print(word[:2] + "Py")
print(word[:2] + "Jy")

# The built-in function len() returns the length of a string:
