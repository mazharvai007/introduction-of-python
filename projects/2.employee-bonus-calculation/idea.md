# Employee Bonus Calculation

You are tasked with implementing a system that calculates bonuses for employees based on various criteria. The bonus
amount is determined by the following rules:

## Base Salary and Performance

- Employees have a base salary, and their performance is rated as "Excellent", "Good", or "Needs Improvement"
- The bonus is a percentage of the base salary, and the percentage depends on both the performance rating and the
  employee's year of experience

## Experience Levels

- Junior: Less than 3 years
- Mid-Level: 3 to 6 years
- Senior: More than 6 years

## Performance Rating and Bonus Percentages

### Excellent

- Junior: 10% bonus
- Mid-Level: 15% bonus
- Senior: 20% bonus

### Good

- Junior: 5% bonus
- Mid-Level: 10% bonus
- Senior: 15% bonus

### Needs Improvement

- Junior: 0% bonus
- Mid-Level: 5% bonus
- Senior: 10% bonus

## Additional Conditions

- If an employee has been promoted to a managerial position, they receive an additional 5% bonus on top of their
  calculated bonus
- If the employee is part-time, the bonus is reduced by 50%
