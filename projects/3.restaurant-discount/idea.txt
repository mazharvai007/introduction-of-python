# Restaurant Discount

You are tasked with creating a Python program for a restaurant that offers different discounts based on the day and time of the week. Write a Python script that prompts the user to input the day of the week and the time (in 24-hours format) they plan to visit the restaurant. based on this information, the program should output the applicable discount offer.

The discount offers are as follows:

## On weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Before 5PM: No discount
- After 5PM: 10% discount on the total bill amount

## On weekends (Saturday and Sunday):
- Before 3PM: 5% discount on the total bill amount
- After 3PM: 7% discount on the total bill amount

Your program should validate the user input to ensure it corresponds to valid days of the week and a valid time format. If the input is invalid, the program should display an appropriate error message and prompt the user to input again.

Your program should use conditional statements to determine the discount offer based on the user input.

# Ensure your code is well-documented and follows Python best practice
