Problem:
Write a Python program that generates a pattern of numbers based on the following conditions:
1. The program should ask the user for an integer input n (where n >= 1). 2. The program should print a pyramid of numbers up to n rows.
    â—‹ Each row should print numbers starting from 1 up to the row number (e.g., row 1 prints 1, row 2 prints 1 2, row 3 prints 1 2 3, etc.).
3. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with the word "Fizz".
4. If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with the word "Buzz".
5. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz". 6. The final output should print the pyramid with "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on the divisibility rules.
Example Output:
For n = 5, the output should be:
1
1 2
1 2 Fizz
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz
