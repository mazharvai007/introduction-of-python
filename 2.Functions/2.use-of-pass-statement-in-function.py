# Empty Function with pass
def fun():
    pass  # function logic to be added later


# Calling the empty function
fun()  # This does show nothing now

# Example with while Loop
i = 0
while i < 10:
    pass
    print(i)
    i += 1
    print("---------------")
    print(i)

print("---------------")


# Example with for Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Example with if-else Statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    pass
else:
    pass
