"""
Inheritance is creating a parent-child relationship between tow classes, where child class will access automatically variables and methods of base or parent class. We can access variables and methods of base class by creating object of child class.

There are 5 types of inheritance in Python

Single Inheritance - A child class inherits from one parent class (One base class and one child/derived class)
Multiple Inheritance - A child class inherits from more than one parent class
Multilevel Inheritance - A class derived from a class which is also derived from another class
Hierarchical Inheritance - Multiple classes inherits from  a single parent class

Hybrid Inheritance - A combination of more than one type of inheritance
